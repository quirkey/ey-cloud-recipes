; To create an admin account uncomment the '[admins]' section below and add a
; line in the format 'username = password'. When you next start CouchDB, it
; will change the password to a hash (so that your passwords don't linger 
; around in plain-text files). You can add more admin accounts with more 
; 'username = password' lines. Don't forget to restart CouchDB after 
; changing this.
